    <h1>A BRIEF DOCUMENTATION OF MAXIMPACT</h1>

    <p>
      MaxImpact is a simple command-line tool for Interaxon Muse and
      is developed to work together with muse-io.exe that is
      distributed in Muse Researcher SDK.
      The tool shows pictures (jpg and png files) from an user
      given directory and measures changes caused by the pictures
      to the watcher who is wearing Interaction Muse.
    </p>

    <p>
      The maximpact.exe listens UDP packets sent to localhost 4545 port
      meaning that muse-io.exe should be run with a command like:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
	muse-io.exe -o osc.udp://localhost:4545
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      After which maximpact command should be
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <code>
	maximpact.exe muse c:\path\to\pictures
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      but it is also possible to test showing of the pictures using a command
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
	maximpact.exe random c:\path\to\pictures
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      which generates random measurements and shows them as the results.
    </p>

    <p>
      After watching the pictures for enough time
      (each picture is shown 200ms per view and the number of views should be
      at least ~30 per picture meaning that for each picture total viewing time
      should increase 6 seconds and to compare/measure 10 pictures total
      viewing time should be about 1 minute).
    </p>

    <h1>USES</h1>

    <p>
      The primary use of this tool is for advertisement
      (a primitive form of <i>neuromarketing</i>). Advertiser can create
      different versions of its banner or ad picture and
      then measure by wearing Interaxon Muse device which pictures cause
      largest change to the users brainwaves, or is the most difficult to
      ignore.
    </p>

    <p>
      The viewing time is kept at very low meaning that only primitive
      form of visual system responses work but it is possible to
      change the viewing time with a extra switch by executing command
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
	maximpact.exe muse c:\path\to\files\ MSECS
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      where MSECS (4th argument) is a time in milliseconds defining how
      long each picture is shown (the default is 200ms).
